            <h1>VEER BHAGAT SINGH</h1>
            <p>Singh was born to Vidyavati Kaur and Sardar Kishan Singh, in a Sikh Jat family on 28 September 1907 at Lyallpur in Punjab Province of British India. His family had earlier been involved in revolutionary activities against the British government.

                His uncle, Swaran Singh, had participated in the freedom struggle against the British. When in 1907, an another uncle of Bhagat, Ajit Singh was arrested and exiled to Rangoon in Burma, Swaran asked the people of Punjab to force the government for his release and due to his efforts Ajit Singh was released from Rangoon Jail in October 1907.
                
                After coming back from jail, Ajit Singh decided to start a major revolt against the British. He began agitating the farmers and peasants to start a movement against them. The movement called 'Pagdi Sambhal Jatta' was launched in 1908.
                
                The British came to know of his intentions and arrested him on 13 January 1911, when he was attending the Lohri festival celebration at his relative's house. In February, Ajit Singh escaped from jail and ran away home, only to inform about his planning to start a mass struggle abroad India. Ajit Singh bid farewell to his family and fled to Persia in March.</p>

                <p>In 1912, Bhagat joined the District Primary School in Lyallpur and received his elementary education there till class 5th. In 1917, his family shifted to Lahore for his higher education. In Lahore, he was admitted to the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic (D.A.V) School, and he received rest of his elementary education from there. When he was in the 8th standard, the Jallianwala Bagh massacre (13 April 1919) took place. The very next day (on 14 April) he went to the bagh telling at his home that he was going to school. After running about 30 miles from Lahore, Bhagat reached Amritsar. At 2 pm, as Bhagat entered the bagh's compound he saw blood scattered all over the ground. The turbans and torn clothes of panic-stricken people laid lifeless on the ground. The walls of the compound were red with blood. As it was curfew in Punjab those days, the blood hadn't been cleaned. Bhagat had taken a glass bottle with him before leaving from home. He took a handful of blood-stained soil and put it in the bottle. He reached home and put the bottle infront of the Sikh Guru's portrait and prayed to him for peace and solace for the victims of the massacre and he pledged to teach the British a lesson.

                    In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement to encourage a mass protest against the British and to boycott their trade in India and to end their cooperation with the British rule. Many people joined the movement and discarded the use of foreign goods and clothes. The people boycotted schools and colleges. Lawyers such as Pandit Nehru's father Motilal boycotted law courts and other government institutions. They publicly burnt their lawyers' dress in protest.</p>
